1. A python program, "skit-learn-ML-iris-data.py" is written to perform some basic tasks on iris flower dataset(iris.csv) using scikit-learn.
   Tasks performed :
                 a) print the keys, a number of rows-columns, feature names, and the description of the Iris data.
                 b) create a plot to get a general Statistics of Iris data. 
                 c) create a graph to find the relationship between the sepal length and width.
                 d) split the iris dataset into 70% train data and 30% test data.

2. Also the python program is used to Predict the response for test dataset using 5 different ML Algorithm and to plot the results.

3. Environment : Google Colab.
